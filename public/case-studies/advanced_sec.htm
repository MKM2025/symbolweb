<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;line-height:115%'>Symbol Tech Fortifies EthSwitch's National Payment
Gateway with Advanced Security Solutions</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</b> –
Symbol Tech recently partnered with EthSwitch S.C., the operator of Ethiopia's
national e-payment switch, to significantly enhance its security
infrastructure. This strategic initiative empowers EthSwitch to protect its
critical operations and customer data, ensuring the integrity and reliability of
the nation's burgeoning digital payment ecosystem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>The Challenge: Securing a
National Financial Hub</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As the backbone for interoperable
ATM, POS, and account-to-account transactions in Ethiopia, EthSwitch recognized
the critical need to bolster its security defenses. The primary driver was to
meet and maintain stringent international security standards, particularly PCI
DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), which is crucial for
handling sensitive cardholder information. EthSwitch required a robust security
overhaul to protect against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, ensure
high availability of its services, and increase its threat detection,
prevention and compliance reporting capabilities. The project,
&quot;Procurement of Datacenter network Infrastructure And Security
Solution&quot; (Procurement Reference No: Ets/NCB/25/2021), specifically its
security solutions component (Lot II), was vital for maintaining trust and
security in Ethiopia's financial technology landscape. &nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>The Solution: A Multi-Layered
Security Fortress by Symbol Tech</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Symbol Tech was contracted to
deliver the comprehensive security solutions outlined in Lot II of the project.
The implementation was planned for completion within four months of contract
signing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Fortified Security Solutions
Delivered by Symbol Tech</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Symbol Tech implemented a robust,
multi-layered security strategy designed to address EthSwitch's unique
operational and compliance needs:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Next-Generation Firewalls
     (NGFW):</b> Redundant NGFWs, capable of virtual contexts/domains, were
     deployed to secure both the network perimeter and internal server farm
     segments. These advanced firewalls included integrated Intrusion
     Prevention Systems (IPS), URL filtering, anti-malware capabilities, and
     IPSEC VPN functionality to meet PCI DSS requirements and provide
     comprehensive threat protection. &nbsp; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Advanced Application
     Security:</b> A high-performance Load Balancer was implemented, critically
     featuring an integrated Web Application Firewall (WAF). This WAF was
     configured to protect EthSwitch’s externally accessible web-based
     e-commerce and related applications from common and sophisticated attacks,
     including the OWASP Top 10 web application threats. &nbsp; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Enhanced Access Control:</b>
     A robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solution was deployed across
     EthSwitch’s systems. This significantly strengthened user verification
     processes and access controls, a core component of a strong identity and
     access management (IAM) policy. &nbsp; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Compliance-Centric Design:</b>
     All security solutions were meticulously designed and implemented to
     ensure EthSwitch meets and can maintain PCI DSS compliance, alongside
     other relevant industry security standards. &nbsp; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Comprehensive Service
     Delivery:</b> Symbol Tech managed the entire lifecycle for the security
     solutions, including the procurement of all necessary hardware and
     software. This was followed by expert installation, seamless integration
     with EthSwitch’s existing and new infrastructure, rigorous testing, and
     final commissioning. Crucially, Symbol Tech also provided detailed
     technical documentation and tailored training programs to empower
     EthSwitch’s IT staff to manage and maintain the new security
     infrastructure effectively. &nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>The Outcome: Enhanced
Security, Compliance, and Trust</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Through the successful completion
of Lot II, Symbol Tech has significantly elevated EthSwitch's security posture,
delivering key benefits:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Strengthened Threat
     Protection:</b> The deployment of NGFWs, WAF, and MFA provides robust
     defense against a wide array of cyber threats, safeguarding critical data
     and infrastructure.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>PCI DSS Compliance:</b> The
     implemented solutions directly address key PCI DSS requirements, enabling
     EthSwitch to maintain its compliance status and secure cardholder data
     effectively. &nbsp; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Increased Visibility and
     Control:</b> The new security infrastructure offers enhanced visibility
     into network traffic and user activity, coupled with granular control over
     security policies.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Improved System Reliability
     and Availability:</b> By protecting against attacks and ensuring secure
     access, the solutions contribute to the overall reliability and
     availability of EthSwitch's national payment services. &nbsp; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Empowered Internal Teams:</b>
     Comprehensive training and documentation provided by Symbol Tech have
     equipped EthSwitch's staff with the necessary skills to operate and manage
     the advanced security systems. &nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Symbol Tech's focused expertise
in deploying advanced security solutions has provided EthSwitch with a
resilient and compliant security framework, reinforcing its capacity to
securely manage and operate Ethiopia's national e-payment switch and foster continued
trust in the nation's digital payment services.</p>
